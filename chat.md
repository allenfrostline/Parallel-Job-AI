Thanks, the `eoq.pdf` is really interesting and I'm now reading the `.py` files. I guess we can keep updating this `.md` file for conversations.

Sure. Like this a bit of delay in downloading is no problem. Git will handle it.

I just checked your changes to eoq.py. No problem. Just in case you don't know, tizk is a really nice package, although programming in it is hard/strange. Matplot2tikz is really useful.

Yeah I know `tikz`. Actually I've been using `tikz` to draw graphs in my lecture notes, and mindmaps for final reviews. The problem is, as you mentioned, it is not user-friendly at all. I'm having an issue importing the `matplot2tikz` package. I'll fixed it on my computer.

I've just checked into the dependencies of `matplotlib2tikz` and it turned out that the `pillow` package, which is required by it, only supports `py3.4`. I get lucky as I have multiple python environments on my computer and the `sS.py` worked when I use `python3.4 sS.py`.

I write it down here in case of any future problems.

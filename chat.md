Thanks, the `eoq.pdf` is really interesting and I'm now reading the `.py` files. I guess we can keep updating this `.md` file for conversations.

Sure. Like this a bit of delay in downloading is no problem. Git will handle it.

I just checked your changes to eoq.py. No problem. Just in case you don't know, tizk is a really nice package, although programming in it is hard/strange. Matplot2tikz is really useful.
